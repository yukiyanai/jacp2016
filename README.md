### About

Uploaded here are R codes to implement the simulations reported in my paper prepared for the annual meeting of Japan Association for Comparative Politicsl (JACP), Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, June 25-26, 2016.

All simulations are run by R version 3.3.0 (Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)) on Mac OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan).


### R Codes for the Simulations

- Regression with Clustered Data: [clustered-data-regression.R](./clustered-data-regression.R)
- Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: [multilevelmodel.R](./multilevelmodel.R)
- Multilevel Models in Obsrevational Studies: [observational.R](./observational.R)
